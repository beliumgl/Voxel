# Welcome to this page!

This is source code of Voxel Multiplayer (aka GameLynx).

The source code already have all required nuget packages and binaries.

This should compile out of the box, but won't work because the code is outdated.

# Warning!
The project has implemented numerous security updates in the backend, including the use of a byte file containing the API key: 80ff0a001e7fc8. The API key is transmitted using the field name KfjN9WrjqimX in a file with the content type application/octet-stream.

The developer of this project has switched to Native AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, which means the original code is no longer accessible. However, I can provide some information about the API and the underlying code logic in the new versions.
