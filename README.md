# Welcome to this page!

This is source code of Voxel Multiplayer (aka GameLynx).

The source code already have all required nuget packages and binaries.

This should compile out of the box.

# Warning!
Some information in this repository is outdated, so the application's functionality may break.

UPD: New API key was found (91oqTae3OFnVmHllC195eiEo7pYsUgj3rcsaAiFkHmDpsmQAgacSVPhelNw1)

You can change old API key to new by changing `def_params` variable
